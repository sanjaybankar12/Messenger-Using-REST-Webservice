# Messenger-Using-REST-Webservice

This Project uses Maven Project using jersey-quickstart-webapp archetypes.

> This is demo project which uses REST API to build social media application like messenger.

> We get JSON/XML response as content negotiation. 

> We add message, write comment to it and many more.

> Actually, This is not a real time project but sure it clears your concept of REST Webservice.
